and through the target without consuming movement or having to roll to move then stuns the target 
for 1 turn. (SNAGA UDARCA to hit harpoon, enemy OTPORNOST to see outcome, harpoon needs to hit to
get My Cut stack)

in current combat) and a hit (resisted or not) of Bone Skewer grants Pyke a stack of My Cut. Stacks do 
not expire.

Death from Below - Pyke leaps towards a target within 1 movement and deals 
(18-SNAGA UDARCA) * (1+My Cut stacks) damage to the target. (auto-hits, cannot be resisted)
